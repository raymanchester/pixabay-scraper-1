# Pixabay-scraper

Python script for scraping images from Pixabay (free stock photography). 

Search list has to be altered to get arbitrary categories. Scrapes first 15 images from every given category and saves to separate folder.

```
search_list = ["database", "computer", "laptop", "work"]  # change keywords for other pics
```
